In short, it&amp;rsquo;s an R package for survival analysis, where we use case-base sampling to fit smooth-in-time hazards. (I could write a post on this package, but there&amp;rsquo;s no need: check out the &lt;a href="https://sahirbhatnagar.com/casebase/">website&lt;/a> and the four vignettes.) As part of our workflow, we perform continuous integration using &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI&lt;/a>, and we test our package against both the current and development versions of R. Recently, some tests began to fail against the development version, and so I had to install R-devel on my local machine in order to debug our code. This blog post is a summary of how I did it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be fair, this is already documented online, and I made use of these resources; see the &lt;a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#Installation">official R installation docs&lt;/a> and this &lt;a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/215488098-Installing-multiple-versions-of-R">RStudio support post&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;m writing yet another post simply as a reference for myself and my colleagues. But I also ran into a compilation error that I wanted to document here. That error was &amp;ldquo;caused&amp;rdquo; by following closely the (amazing) book &lt;a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/">&lt;em>R packages&lt;/em>&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="http://hadley.nz/">Hadley Wickham&lt;/a>. Stick around to learn what the problem was!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Removing all R CMD check warnings</title><link>https://maxturgeon.ca/blog/2016-04-08-check-warnings/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maxturgeon.ca/blog/2016-04-08-check-warnings/</guid><description>&lt;p>Making R packages is an important aspect of the statistician&amp;rsquo;s work. Or at least it should be: it is quite annoying when a new method appears in the literature but no implementation is readily available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A favourite mantra of mine when making R packages is the following: &lt;strong>an R package is more than the sum of its functions&lt;/strong>. A functioning R package needs to be able to interact properly with the R environment (through the &lt;code>NAMESPACE&lt;/code>); a good R package also needs great documentation; a great R package will also include a vignette to guide new users and explain how all the functions interact with one another.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main reference for how to make R packages is &lt;a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html">&lt;em>Writing R extensions&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. Everything you need to know is there, if you know what you are looking for. Another, very useful reference is Hadley Wickam&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/">book on R packages&lt;/a>. This book explains the different components of an R package, and it also serves as an introduction to his &lt;a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools">&lt;code>devtools&lt;/code> package&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In what follows, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go over how to make an R package; the above references do a better job than I could hope to do. Rather, I want to share my experience about some of the most annoying part of making an R package: passing the &lt;code>R CMD check&lt;/code>. Removing the errors is the most important part, and what kind of errors you get really depends on the package (the log file is typically quite useful in figuring out what triggered the errors). On the other hand, you also want to minimize the number of warnings and notes, and most warnings you probably want to remove altogether.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
