      <description>&lt;p&gt;Classical statistics often assumes that the analyst knows which variables are important and which variables are not. Of course, this is a strong assumption, and therefore many variable selection procedures have been developed to address this problem. In this blog post, I want to focus on two subset selection methods, and I want to address their instability. In other words, I want to discuss how &lt;strong&gt;small changes&lt;/strong&gt; in the data can lead to &lt;strong&gt;completely different solutions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
