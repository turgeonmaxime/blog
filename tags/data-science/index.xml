At the point, I was only wrapping up the third year of my PhD, and so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessary looking for a job. But one thing led to another, and I ended up applying for a new biostatistician position with the Saskatoon Health Region (SHR).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The job description talked about being a connection point between the health care system and the Saskatchewan Centre for Patient-Oriented Research (&lt;a href="scpor.ca">SCPOR&lt;/a>), by providing both study design and methodological support for researchers. I thought I would be a good fit: McGill&amp;rsquo;s focus on data analysis and report writing provided me the tools to do the job; meanwhile I could learn more about the health care system itself and use my academic background to provide effective consultation to researchers.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
