      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, on January 20th 2017, Donald J. Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the USA. He also gave what seemed like a very short inaugural address, and so I was curious to see how short it really was compared to previous addresses. It was also an opportunity to have a quick look at other properties of his speech.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
