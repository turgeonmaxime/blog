I am finally launching my personal website! It will mainly be used to share my projects and my thoughts about statistics. I will also share the slides from my talks and the occasional tutorial, whenever I feel I've learned some interesting stuff in my work (be it statistical or related to programming).

In the meantime, I encourage you to take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/turgeonmaxime"> Github page</a>, where you can see some of the projects I've contributed to.

Finally, please note that this website is powered by [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/), [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), and [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), it is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/), and I used the [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) template provided by [poole](http://getpoole.com/).
