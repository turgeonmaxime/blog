I should probably be working on my thesis, but instead I started reading through the introduction to the R package [`leaflet`](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/). And the following made me feel excited: [Code for America](https://codeforamerica.org) has GeoJSON data on their [Github page](https://github.com/codeforamerica/click_that_hood) for several cities in the world. In particular, they have both Saskatoon and Montreal! I used the `leaflet` package to draw the boundaries of each neighbourhoods. You can see the results [here](http://rpubs.com/turgeonmaxime/leaflet-saskatoon). (I wasn't able to host the maps directly on this webpage.) The next step would be to colour-code the neighbourhoods according to interesting statistics!
