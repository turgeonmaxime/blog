For the past few years, I have tried to predict the winners in all categories at the Academy Awards. And [for the past two years](oscar-predictions-2016), I've also used statistics and data analysis to inform my decision in four categories: Best Picure, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress. 

As for the last two years, I stick to what the model tells me for my prediction in these categories. However, I'm skeptical about the predictions I have for the acting categories. First, for best actor, Denzel Washington and Casey Affleck are the only two front-runners--there is no way Ryan Gosling will win this award. Second, for best actress, although I would argue that Emma Stone is now the favourite, Isabelle Huppert definitely has a chance too. Therefore, I expect to miss one of these categories.

Finally, this year is definitely *La La Land*'s show: 14 nominations, tied with [*Titanic*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/) and [*All About Eve*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042192/) for the most ever. I don't think it will set a new record (which is 11 wins), but I expect them to win around 10 awards. I don't expect them to run the tables in the sound/music categories--which would be a first for a musical. I think the only one of these four awards they could miss is Best Sound Editing, which I predict will probably go to *Arrival*.

My predictions are below, in bold. After the Academy Awards, I will update this post and point out the winners--I will indicate them in italics.

**Update (2017/02/27)**: Wow! What a [finale](https://youtu.be/rvK-g1rehpU)! As for my predictions, I did better than last year: 16/24.
